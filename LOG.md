I do believe that the benefits of providing safe and debug builds will
be worth the effort. However, don't sacrifice to much readability on
it, and perhaps most important - don't get stuck because of them. If
they manage to catch five or more otherwise untracable bugs they will
probably make up for the time implementing them.

There is a GNU library for linear algebra (and allot of other math
related stuff) called GNU Scientific Library. I don't think that much
math needed for the program but it can be good to know.
